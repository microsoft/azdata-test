This module helps you test Azure Data Studio extensions by providing a test runner as well as various stubs and mocks. 

This is a fork of the [vscode-test](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test) package.

Supported:

- Node >= 8.x
- Windows >= Windows Server 2012+ / Win10+ (anything with Powershell >= 5.0)
- macOS
- Linux

## Stubs and Mocks

This package provides a set of basic stubs and mocks to help test various parts of the Azure Data Studio extensibility layer which are difficult or repetitive for extensions to implement themselves.

These are located in the `lib/mocks` and `lib/stubs` folders.
## Usage

See [./sample](./sample) for a runnable sample, with [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://github.com/microsoft/azdata-test/blob/master/sample/azure-pipelines.yml) and [Travis CI](https://github.com/microsoft/azdata-test/blob/master/.travis.yml) configuration.

```ts
async function go() {
	try {
		const extensionDevelopmentPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../')
		const extensionTestsPath = path.resolve(__dirname, './suite')

		/**
		 * Basic usage
		 */
		await runTests({
			extensionDevelopmentPath,
			extensionTestsPath
		})

		const extensionTestsPath2 = path.resolve(__dirname, './suite2')
		const testWorkspace = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../../test-fixtures/fixture1')

		/**
		 * Running another test suite on a specific workspace
		 */
		await runTests({
			extensionDevelopmentPath,
			extensionTestsPath: extensionTestsPath2,
			launchArgs: [testWorkspace]
		})

		/**
		 * Use 1.36.1 release for testing
		 */
		await runTests({
			version: '1.36.1',
			extensionDevelopmentPath,
			extensionTestsPath,
			launchArgs: [testWorkspace]
		})

		/**
		 * Use Insiders release for testing
		 */
		await runTests({
			version: 'insiders',
			extensionDevelopmentPath,
			extensionTestsPath,
			launchArgs: [testWorkspace]
		})

		/**
		 * Noop, since 1.36.1 already downloaded to .ads-test/ads-1.36.1
		 */
		await downloadAndUnzipAzureDataStudio('1.36.1')

		/**
		 * Manually download Azure Data Studio 1.35.0 release for testing.
		 */
		const azureDataStudioExecutablePath = await downloadAndUnzipAzureDataStudio('1.35.0')
		await runTests({
			azureDataStudioExecutablePath,
			extensionDevelopmentPath,
			extensionTestsPath,
			launchArgs: [testWorkspace]
		})

		/**
		 * Install Python extension
		 */
		const cliPath = resolveCliPathFromAzureDataStudioExecutablePath(azureDataStudioExecutablePath)
		cp.spawnSync(cliPath, ['--install-extension', 'ms-python.python'], {
			encoding: 'utf-8',
			stdio: 'inherit'
		})

		/**
		 * - Add additional launch flags for Azure Data Studio
		 * - Pass custom environment variables to test runner
		 */
		await runTests({
			azureDataStudioExecutablePath,
			extensionDevelopmentPath,
			extensionTestsPath,
			launchArgs: [
				testWorkspace,
				// This disables all extensions except the one being testing
				'--disable-extensions'
			],
			// Custom environment variables for extension test script
			extensionTestsEnv: { foo: 'bar' }
		})

	} catch (err) {
		console.error('Failed to run tests')
		process.exit(1)
	}
}

go()
```

## Development

- `yarn install`
- Make necessary changes in [`lib`](./lib)
- `yarn compile` (or `yarn watch`)
- In [`sample`](./sample), run `yarn install`, `yarn compile` and `yarn test` to make sure integration test can run successfully

## Releasing

Release a new version of the extension by:

1. Run `npm run release`
2. Run `git push --follow-tags origin main`
3. The release will be created in Github automatically by the CD pipeline, go to it and download the package artifact (tgz)
4. Run `npm publish <path to tarball>`
